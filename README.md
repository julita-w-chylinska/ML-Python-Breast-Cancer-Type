# ML-Python-breast-cancer-type

This project demonstrates the [basic] proccess of building ML model for predicting whether the breast tumor* is benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The goal was to built a model with at leart 0.95 accuracy score. This solution should help doctors make faster diagnoses and, therefore, reduce mortality. The process involved data preprocessing, chossing valid variables based on correlations, training a model and evaluating it.

*the data set says "cancer", but – in fact – cancer can't be benign, it's always malignant, so actually there is differentiation between types of tumors
